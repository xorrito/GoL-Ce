Game Of Life Cell Edition

Inspired by the video uploaded by Veritasium titled "How Long Will You Live?" were it was mentioned that a cell has a finite amount of times that it can divide.
Were it was noted that it was discovered that it was an averaged of 50 times max.

Along with inspiration from the famous "Game of Life" by John Conway.

I made this 'emulator/simulation' of cell divisions.

Here you get the option to select the max number of live the initial cell has and the percentage change of multiple cells dividing at the same time.

Total amount of possible divisions will be calculated on the bar on the bottom left.

Red bar indicates total amount of cells divided.
White bar indicates a maximum amount of cells alive at any point of the simulation.
Blue bar indicates total cells currently alive.

The cells will indicate their lives withing them.
Red cells are on their last life and will die on the next division.
Offspring will spawn adjacent to the parent cell and will flash.


Cells are randomly selective for division, once they device the parent's and offspring's life goes down by 1.
